# TCP-Client
1) Do git clone [gitlink]
2) Then do python3 TCP-Client.py
3) Then the client will send some data to that IP, and that is pretty much it, you should get a response back. You can change the IP section to anything you want such as www.facebook.com etc. You can use this TCP-Client to connect to the TCP-server aswell if you wanted to.
